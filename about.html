            <ul id="facts-list">
                <p>Chess, one of the world’s most strategic and enduring games, has a rich history that dates back over
                    1,500 years.
                    It originated in India around the 6th century as a game called Chaturanga, which featured elements
                    resembling
                    modern chess—infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, representing pawns, knights, bishops, and
                    rooks. From there,
                    it spread to Persia, where it became Shatranj, and later to the Islamic world, where scholars
                    refined its rules.
                    By the Middle Ages, chess had reached Europe, evolving into the game we recognize today, with
                    significant rule changes
                    in the 15th century—introducing powerful moves for the queen and bishop—that made the game faster
                    and more dynamic.
                    By the 19th century, chess had become a global intellectual battleground, leading to the first
                    official World Chess Championship in 1886.
                    Today, with computers and artificial intelligence challenging even the best human minds, chess
                    continues to evolve,
                    proving itself as a timeless game of strategy, patience, and mastery.</p>
